## GUI with Flatlaf UI


[Flatlaf](https://www.formdev.com/flatlaf) is a modern open-source cross-platform Look and Feel for Java Swing desktop applications.

It looks almost flat (no shadows or gradients), clean, simple and elegant. FlatLaf comes with Light, Dark, IntelliJ and Darcula themes, scales on HiDPI displays and runs on Java 8 or newer.

The look is heavily inspired by Darcula and IntelliJ themes from IntelliJ IDEA 2019.2+ and uses almost the same colors and icons.
